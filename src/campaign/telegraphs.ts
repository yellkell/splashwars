/**
 * Attack telegraphs for the ARCADE titans — the whole "souls-like" readability
 * contract lives here. Every titan strike marks its kill zone ON THE PLAYER'S
 * PLATFORM while it charges: hazard-amber shapes that fill up and shift to
 * danger-red as the strike arrives (the fill IS the countdown). The boss's
 * current palette rides in the moving detail, but never replaces that shared
 * safety language. The family includes:
 *
 *  - CIRCLE  : a fist slam / mortar shell footprint — step out of the disc.
 *  - BEAM    : a strip the eye-beam will rake — sidestep off the line.
 *  - SWEEP   : a horizontal blade slice across the platform at a marked
 *              height — duck under it (a floor band shows it's coming).
 *  - HALF    : one side floods while bands drive you across the centre rail.
 *  - NOVA    : danger everywhere except a visibly flowing cool safe wedge.
 *  - VOLLEY  : counted, hovering gel seeds that pop on each release beat.
 *
 * All shader-driven planes; cheap, additive, no textures.
